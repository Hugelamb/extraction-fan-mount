# Prototyping Notes

## Hole Sizing
- Need to increase hole sizing for using heat inserts later on
- Should counter sink holes for cleaner look on finish
- Think about what screw lengths I have access to in terms of where screws should be enteringf the body

## Tolerances
- Base plate should not be press fit, as becomes impossible to remove without pushing from inside.
